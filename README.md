# Solid Photo App

For the Inrupt Solid Hackathon 2023. 

## What

A Solid-based photo app.

1. Select and upload one or more images
2. The image and the image metadata (EXIF) will be stored on the Pod (`/photos`)
3. The images will be displayed in the frontend UI
4. Clicking on a image shows a bigger version, including the metadata

Note: If there are many images on the Pod, it may take some time until they get displayed in the app.

### Planned but not finished, possible future improvements

- Filtering for metadata, tags, ...
- Editing of metadata
- Visualization of the metadata graph
- Extending the graph with external sources (Wikidata..)
